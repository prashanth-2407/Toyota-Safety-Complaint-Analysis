üîç Deep Dive: Complaints Involving Deaths
A total of 21 complaints involving fatalities were registered between 2020 and 2024.

The models most frequently mentioned were Camry, Corolla, and 4Runner.

Using the Mistral Large Language Model, key vehicle systems responsible for the incidents were extracted from the complaint descriptions (CDESCR field).

Identified systems linked to fatal outcomes:

Airbag Malfunction

Steering System Failure

Battery and Electrical System Failure

üî• Deep Dive: Complaints Involving Fire Incidents
A total of 307 fire-related complaints were recorded from 2020 to 2024.

Models most frequently involved were RAV4, Camry, and Highlander.

The Mistral LLM was used to extract system-level causes from the complaint text.

Commonly identified causes of fire incidents:

Electrical System Failure

Component Overheating
